# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python

This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. It's a great project for beginners who are learning the basics of programming with Python. By creating this game, learners can gain hands-on experience with conditional statements, user input, and random number generation.

# How to Play:
To play the game, simply run the `rock_paper_scissors.py` file in your Python environment. The game will prompt you to enter your choice of rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will randomly generate its choice, and the winner will be determined based on the classic game rules:
- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock
The game will continue until you choose to exit.

# Snake, Water, Gun Game:
A similar variation of this game is the Snake, Water, Gun game. In this game, the user and computer choose between Snake, Water, or Gun, and the winner is determined based on the following rules:
- Snake drinks water, but is killed by gun.
- Water erodes gun, but is defeated by snake.
- Gun shoots snake, but is rusted by water.
Implementing this game in Python is a great way to practice your programming skills and have some fun at the same time.

# Conclusion:
Creating simple games like Rock, Paper, Scissors and Snake, Water, Gun is a great way to get started with programming in Python. By building these games, you can gain hands-on experience with basic programming concepts and have some fun at the same time. Enjoy!
